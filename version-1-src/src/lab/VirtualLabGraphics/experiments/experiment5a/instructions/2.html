<p>
This experiment shows the effect of a series of transformations applied on a triangle.
</p>
<p>
We start with a scaling transformation applied to the triangle followed by a translation, rotation and another translation.
All these transformations are animated.

Drag the slider at the bottom to go forwards or backwards in the animation.

The order of transformations can be edited from the transformation edit panel. New transformations could be added as well as edited.
Double click on <code>Transformation 1</code>, followed by the corresponding transformation to view the details of the transformation applied.
Note that transformations about z axis will be visible only if you check the <code>3D</code> box under <code>Display</code> tab before proceeding.
