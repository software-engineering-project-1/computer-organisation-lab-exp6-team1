<p>
This experiment is designed to teach how a sequence of transformations work when applied to a geometry.
</p>
<p>
The world represented as a tree is shown below.
Each node is an instance. Each instance has 3 sections: Coodinate system, shape/instance, Transformation.
Coordinate system is the local coordinate system of the instance.
Shape/Instance is the geometry or a child instance of the cuurent instance.
Transformation is the set of transformations applied to the shape or instance wrt local coordinate system.
