<p>
This experiment shows the effect of transformations in a hierarchical model.
</p>
<p>
We constructed a hierarchical articulated arm model where each node/part follows a series of transformations from the root node to its current position. The top-most object in this hierarchy is the Shoulder followed by Elbow, Forearm, Wrist and Palm.
</p>
<p>
We applied a rotation transformation to the wrist where only the wrist and palm moves. The coordinate system of the wrist is set at <i>(6,0,0)</i> wrt the elbow's frame of reference.
This is followed by a rotation applied to elbow which moves the forearm, wrist and palm. The coordinate system of the elbow is set at <i>(1,-4,0)</i> wrt the shoulder's frame of reference.
And finally a rotation at the shoulder which is at the top-most level of the hierarchy moves all nodes/parts. The coordinate system of the shoulder is coincided with the Global fixed coordinate system by setting the origin at <i>(0,0,0)</i>
Each node in this heirarchical model has a Shape and a child node.

The transformations at each level of hierarchy can be edited by double clicking on the <code>Transformation</code> node of the corresponding level.
