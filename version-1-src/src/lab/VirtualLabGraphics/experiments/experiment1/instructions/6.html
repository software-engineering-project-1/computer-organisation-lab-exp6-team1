&bull; The experiment starts in 2D for simplicity but you can switch to 3D at any point by going to the <code>Display</code> tab and clicking the <code>3D</code> checkbox.

<p>&bull; Instead of working with a single point, you can load new shapes. Click on <code>New</code> and choose a shape from the drop-down.
It has been pre-loaded with a few shapes but you can supply your own PLY file for a shape.
